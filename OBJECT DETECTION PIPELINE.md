[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)
### Prerequisite
- Understanding of [Transfer Learning](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2019/02/07/what-is-transfer-learning/)
- Understanding of [NVIDIA Transfer Learning Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/tlt/tlt-user-guide/text/overview.html)
- Understaning of [Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/kubeflow-overview/)

### Why we need this pipeline
This pipeline uses TLT which is a Python package hosted on the NVIDIA Python Package Index. It interacts with lower-level TLT dockers available from the NVIDIA GPU Accelerated Container Registry (NGC); This pipline takes the dataset, specification files and input from the user and generates the pruned and quantized model which can be deployed on the inferencing platform providing an end to end solution

### PIPELINE WORKFLOW
![Solid](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/singh-atul/Data_for_tlt/main/workflow.jpg)]

1. User needs to give url to download the input yaml. Details on the creation of input yaml is discussed below
2. Dataset gets downloaded from the  url mentioned in the input yaml and gets stored in the Persistent Volume
3. Download the pretrained model from the [NGC catlog](https://ngc.nvidia.com/)
4. Convert the dataset to tf Records
5. Augment the dataset if specified 
6. Perform the training using the current dataset
7. Perform model Pruning
8. Retraing the model to over come to loss in accuaray at pruning stage 
9. Convert the model into quantized form 
10. Get the output as the Calibration cache and quantized trained model

>Note: The augmentation can be used as a seperate component with individual spec file containg the specific hyperparameters but in the current pipeline user can specify the augmentation details in the training pipeline itself so there wont be any sperate component for augmenting the data.

## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [Ace Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
- [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
- [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
- [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
- [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
- [Gulp] - the streaming build system
- [Breakdance](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/) - HTML
to Markdown converter
- [jQuery] - duh

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

## Installation

Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd dillinger
npm i
node app
```

For production environments...

```sh
npm install --production
NODE_ENV=production node app
```

## Plugins

Dillinger is currently extended with the following plugins.
Instructions on how to use them in your own application are linked below.

| Plugin | README |
| ------ | ------ |
| Dropbox | [plugins/dropbox/README.md][PlDb] |
| GitHub | [plugins/github/README.md][PlGh] |
| Google Drive | [plugins/googledrive/README.md][PlGd] |
| OneDrive | [plugins/onedrive/README.md][PlOd] |
| Medium | [plugins/medium/README.md][PlMe] |
| Google Analytics | [plugins/googleanalytics/README.md][PlGa] |

## Development

Want to contribute? Great!

Dillinger uses Gulp + Webpack for fast developing.
Make a change in your file and instantaneously see your updates!

Open your favorite Terminal and run these commands.

First Tab:

```sh
node app
```

Second Tab:

```sh
gulp watch
```

(optional) Third:

```sh
karma test
```

#### Building for source

For production release:

```sh
gulp build --prod
```

Generating pre-built zip archives for distribution:

```sh
gulp build dist --prod
```

## Docker

Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 8080, so change this within the
Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to
build the image.

```sh
cd dillinger
docker build -t <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version} .
```

This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies.
Be sure to swap out `${package.json.version}` with the actual
version of Dillinger.

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on
your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to
port 8080 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart=always --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN --name=dillinger <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version}
```

> Note: `--capt-add=SYS-ADMIN` is required for PDF rendering.

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in
your preferred browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:8000
```
